        "notes": "Given their head-to-head record is perfectly balanced at 3-3, but this being their first meeting on clay, I expect the surface to be a significant differentiating factor. Clay historically favors Kasatkina's playing style, with her superior movement and defensive capabilities being particularly effective on this surface. Additionally, her recent tournament history in Charleston, reaching the finals last year, demonstrates her comfort on these courts. While Kenin has shown flashes of her former top-level play, her early exit in last year's tournament and lower ranking suggest less consistency. I predict with moderate certainty given the clear surface advantage but acknowledge their competitive history. Results are slightly skewed toward a Kasatkina victory due to the surface advantage and her higher current ranking. There is a relatively low risk of extreme outcomes given both players' demonstrated ability to compete against each other, though the clay court factor introduces some additional variance.",

        "question": "What is the probability that Darya Kasatkina will lose to Sofia Kenin in their Round of 16 match at WTA Charleston?",
        "notes": "Based on my analysis, I expect a significant chance of a Kasatkina loss given the surface dynamics and recent history. While Kasatkina has demonstrated strong clay court capabilities historically, her particular playing style matches up vulnerably against Kenin's aggressive baseline game. The level of uncertainty in this prediction is moderate, considering their even head-to-head record and the variable nature of early-round matches. Results are slightly skewed toward a higher probability of defeat, given Kenin's recent resurgence in form and previous success on clay courts. Their past matches suggest a pattern of trading victories, and with Kasatkina winning their last encounter, the pendulum could swing the other way. There's a meaningful risk of extreme outcomes, particularly if Kenin finds her rhythm early and exploits Kasatkina's occasional serving vulnerabilities. The tournament's conditions and Kasatkina's previous year's finals appearance do factor in, but don't significantly alter the core probability assessment.",

        "notes": "I expect Kasatkina to have a significant advantage in this clay court match, given her superior current ranking and strong previous performance at Charleston. Her playing style is particularly well-suited to clay, where her defensive skills and ability to construct points can shine. While their head-to-head record is even, those matches were all on hard courts, which typically favor Kenin's more aggressive style. Results are likely skewed right, reflecting Kasatkina's clay court prowess and recent form. I predict with moderately high certainty given the surface advantage, though there remains some uncertainty due to Kenin's past success as a Grand Slam champion and her ability to raise her level in important matches. The outcomes are quite concentrated around my expected probability, as both players are experienced professionals who should deliver relatively consistent performances.

Based on their historical matchups showing equal performance, and Kenin's ability to disrupt rhythm, my expectation sits firmly in favor of an upset. The results are likely skewed toward a Kenin victory, particularly given Kasatkina's potential psychological burden from last year's final loss at this venue. While I predict with moderate certainty around the central estimate, there's some risk of extreme outcomes due to the surface transition and their contrasting styles.

Results are slightly skewed right, acknowledging Kenin's potential for upset despite being lower ranked, given her Grand Slam pedigree.
