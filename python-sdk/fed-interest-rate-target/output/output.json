        "notes": "Given recent economic data showing persistent inflation above target and solid economic growth, I expect a relatively low probability of a rate cut at the May meeting. My prediction carries moderate uncertainty due to increased economic headwinds from recent tariff policies and slightly softening labor markets. Results are somewhat skewed toward lower probabilities, reflecting the Fed's current cautious stance and their recent decision to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction rather than cut rates. The distribution suggests outcomes are concentrated around maintaining current rates, though there remains a small but meaningful chance of a cut if economic conditions deteriorate more quickly than expected.",
