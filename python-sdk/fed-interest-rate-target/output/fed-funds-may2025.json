        "notes": "Based on the March 2025 FOMC statement and recent economic data, I expect a moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting. The Fed's language suggests they are moving closer to cutting rates, with inflation continuing to moderate and increased uncertainty in the economic outlook. I predict with moderate certainty given the clear signals from the Fed about their intentions to begin cutting rates in 2025, though the exact timing remains somewhat uncertain. The distribution of possible outcomes is skewed slightly toward higher probabilities, reflecting the Fed's established pattern of telegraphing their intentions before acting. The risk of extreme outcomes is relatively low given the Fed's recent careful and methodical approach to policy changes.",

        "notes": "Looking at the recent Fed statements and economic data, I expect the Fed to maintain its cautious stance, with uncertainty skewed toward keeping rates higher for longer. The recent rise in tariffs creates additional inflationary pressures that make rate cuts less likely in the near term. While recent data shows inflation trending down, it remains somewhat elevated and labor markets remain solid, suggesting the Fed will be patient before making further cuts. My predictions reflect a moderate level of uncertainty, with outcomes slightly skewed toward maintaining current rates rather than cutting.",

        "notes": "Given the March FOMC statement showing continued economic strength but acknowledging elevated inflation, I expect a moderate probability of a rate cut in May. The recent tariff announcements create upward pressure on inflation, suggesting more caution from the Fed. Results are lopsided toward lower probabilities, reflecting the Fed's demonstrated patience in ensuring inflation is decisively trending toward target before cutting rates. The uncertainties around global trade tensions and their impact on prices create a meaningful risk of extreme outcomes, though my prediction centers around a cautious approach by the Fed.",

The March 2025 FOMC statement noted that economic activity remains solid but uncertainty has increased, while inflation remains somewhat elevated - suggesting the Fed will maintain a cautious approach. Given recent tariff implementations and their potential dampening effect on economic growth, combined with Core PCE trending down to 2.6%, conditions are becoming more favorable for easing.
