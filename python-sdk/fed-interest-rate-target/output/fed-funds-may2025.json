        "notes": "Based on the March FOMC statement and recent economic data, I expect a moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting. The Fed's recent signals suggest continued caution, with inflation still somewhat elevated but showing progress toward the 2% target. The economic environment presents mixed signals, with solid growth but increasing uncertainty, while new tariff policies could create upward price pressures. Results are lopsided toward a higher probability of maintaining current rates, though there is meaningful chance of a cut given the Fed's stated intention for some easing this year.",

        "notes": "Given the recent FOMC statement indicating continued economic expansion, solid labor markets, and somewhat elevated inflation, I expect the Fed to maintain a cautious approach. The decision to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction suggests a gradual pivot, but my analysis points to notable uncertainty around the May meeting timing. The outcomes are slightly skewed toward maintaining current rates, particularly given the new tariff policies that could reignite inflationary pressures. However, there remains a meaningful chance of a rate cut given the downward trajectory of core PCE inflation and subtle labor market softening.",

The Fed's pause in March while announcing a slowdown in balance sheet reduction suggests they are preparing markets for eventual easing.

While the Fed has signaled potential rate cuts in 2025, the timing remains uncertain, especially with recent tariff implementations potentially creating new inflationary pressures. The outcomes are somewhat skewed toward maintaining rates, particularly given the Fed's recent cautious approach and preference for maintaining higher rates until inflation is firmly under control.
