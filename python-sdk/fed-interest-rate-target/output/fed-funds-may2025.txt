Q: What is the probability that the Fed will lower its target federal funds rate range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 FOMC meeting?

Pred: (40.67%*, 59.33%)

A: Based on the March 2025 FOMC statement and recent economic data, I expect a moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting. The Fed's language suggests they are moving closer to cutting rates, with inflation continuing to moderate and increased uncertainty in the economic outlook. I predict with moderate certainty given the clear signals from the Fed about their intentions to begin cutting rates in 2025, though the exact timing remains somewhat uncertain. The distribution of possible outcomes is skewed slightly toward higher probabilities, reflecting the Fed's established pattern of telegraphing their intentions before acting. The risk of extreme outcomes is relatively low given the Fed's recent careful and methodical approach to policy changes.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (31.77%, 68.23%*)

A: Looking at the recent Fed statements and economic data, I expect the Fed to maintain its cautious stance, with uncertainty skewed toward keeping rates higher for longer. The recent rise in tariffs creates additional inflationary pressures that make rate cuts less likely in the near term. While recent data shows inflation trending down, it remains somewhat elevated and labor markets remain solid, suggesting the Fed will be patient before making further cuts. My predictions reflect a moderate level of uncertainty, with outcomes slightly skewed toward maintaining current rates rather than cutting.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will lower its target federal funds rate range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 FOMC meeting?

Pred: (33.15%*, 66.85%)

A: Given the March FOMC statement showing continued economic strength but acknowledging elevated inflation, I expect a moderate probability of a rate cut in May. The recent tariff announcements create upward pressure on inflation, suggesting more caution from the Fed. Results are lopsided toward lower probabilities, reflecting the Fed's demonstrated patience in ensuring inflation is decisively trending toward target before cutting rates. The uncertainties around global trade tensions and their impact on prices create a meaningful risk of extreme outcomes, though my prediction centers around a cautious approach by the Fed.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT lower the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 07, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (31.30%, 68.70%*)

A: Given the recent March FOMC statement indicating elevated inflation and solid economic activity, I expect rates to remain steady with moderately high probability. My conviction is strengthened by the hawkish dissent from Christopher Waller and the Fed's demonstrated patience in recent meetings. The outcomes are somewhat skewed toward maintaining current rates given the new tariff policies that could reignite inflationary pressures. However, there remains meaningful uncertainty due to the projected rate cuts for 2025 and gradually improving inflation metrics.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will lower its target federal funds rate range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 FOMC meeting?

Pred: (29.63%*, 70.37%)

A: I expect a moderate probability of a rate cut at the May meeting, given the Fed's recent pause and signals in the March statement about elevated inflation and solid economic growth. The distribution of outcomes is skewed toward lower probabilities, reflecting the Fed's cautious approach and uncertainty around new tariff impacts on inflation. Results are likely concentrated around my central estimate due to clear Fed communication, though there is some risk of extreme outcomes given potential economic shocks from trade policy changes.

[Negative]

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (37.01%, 62.99%*)

A: Given the recent Fed statements and economic data, I expect there's a moderate likelihood the Fed will maintain current rates rather than cut. While inflation has moderated to 2.6%, it remains somewhat elevated relative to target, and economic activity continues to expand at a solid pace. My prediction reflects considerable uncertainty given competing factors including new tariffs that could reignite inflation pressures versus gradually rising unemployment that might warrant easing. Results are slightly skewed toward maintaining rates given the Fed's demonstrated patience in recent meetings and their emphasis on being data dependent.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will lower its target federal funds rate range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 FOMC meeting?

Pred: (36.07%*, 63.93%)

A: I expect there is a moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting, based on several key factors. The March 2025 FOMC statement noted that economic activity remains solid but uncertainty has increased, while inflation remains somewhat elevated - suggesting the Fed will maintain a cautious approach. Given recent tariff implementations and their potential dampening effect on economic growth, combined with Core PCE trending down to 2.6%, conditions are becoming more favorable for easing. However, I predict with relatively low certainty due to the complex mix of factors at play. The outcomes are slightly skewed toward a higher probability of no change, reflecting the Fed's historically cautious approach when beginning a cutting cycle.

[Negative]

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (27.13%, 72.87%*)

A: Given the recent pause in rate cuts and the Fed's cautious stance amid economic uncertainty, I expect there's a strong likelihood they will maintain current rates. The significantly elevated tariffs being implemented could reignite inflationary pressures, making the Fed hesitant to cut rates. My prediction shows high certainty around maintaining current rates, with results skewed toward keeping rates steady rather than cutting them, though there remains a small chance of external shocks forcing action.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will lower its target federal funds rate range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 FOMC meeting?

Pred: (37.39%*, 62.61%)

A: I expect there is a moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting given several key factors. The March 2025 FOMC statement noted increased economic uncertainty while acknowledging that inflation remains somewhat elevated, suggesting a cautious approach to easing. Results are skewed toward a somewhat higher probability of maintaining current rates, given the Fed's recent history of extended pauses and emphasis on data dependence. Recent tariff implementations create additional uncertainty around inflation expectations, though the planned slowdown in balance sheet reduction signals some appetite for easier policy.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT lower the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (37.70%, 62.30%*)

A: Given recent Fed communications and economic data, I expect there's a moderate chance the Fed maintains current rates. My prediction reflects increased uncertainty due to new tariffs potentially reigniting inflation pressures, while acknowledging the Fed's clear signal of planned cuts in 2025. Results are slightly skewed toward maintaining rates, as the Fed has demonstrated patience in ensuring inflation is truly contained before cutting. The distribution shows concentrated probability around the expectation, though with some tail risk due to potential market disruptions from the new tariff regime.
