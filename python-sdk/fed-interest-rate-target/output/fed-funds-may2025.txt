Q: What is the probability that the Fed will change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (30.63%*, 69.37%)

A: Based on the March FOMC statement and recent economic data, I expect a moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting. The Fed's recent signals suggest continued caution, with inflation still somewhat elevated but showing progress toward the 2% target. The economic environment presents mixed signals, with solid growth but increasing uncertainty, while new tariff policies could create upward price pressures. Results are lopsided toward a higher probability of maintaining current rates, though there is meaningful chance of a cut given the Fed's stated intention for some easing this year.

[Negative]

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT lower its target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (31.00%, 69.00%*)

A: Given the recent FOMC statement indicating continued economic expansion, solid labor markets, and somewhat elevated inflation, I expect the Fed to maintain a cautious approach. The decision to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction suggests a gradual pivot, but my analysis points to notable uncertainty around the May meeting timing. The outcomes are slightly skewed toward maintaining current rates, particularly given the new tariff policies that could reignite inflationary pressures. However, there remains a meaningful chance of a rate cut given the downward trajectory of core PCE inflation and subtle labor market softening.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (37.42%*, 62.58%)

A: Based on recent Fed communications and economic data, I expect a moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting. The Fed's pause in March while announcing a slowdown in balance sheet reduction suggests they are preparing markets for eventual easing. Results are lopsided toward the lower probability range given persistent inflation concerns and recent tariff announcements that could be inflationary. I predict with moderate certainty given the clear Fed signaling but recognize there is a risk of fat tails due to uncertainty around upcoming economic data and potential trade shock impacts.

[Negative]

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (28.14%, 71.86%*)

A: Given recent economic indicators showing solid growth and somewhat elevated inflation, combined with the Fed's cautious approach evidenced in the March meeting minutes, I expect this outcome has a high likelihood. My confidence is bolstered by the pattern of gradual policy adjustments and the Fed's clear communication about waiting for more concrete evidence of sustained disinflation. The distribution is moderately skewed toward higher probabilities of maintaining current rates, reflecting the Fed's demonstrated patience in this easing cycle.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (41.50%*, 58.50%)

A: Looking at recent Fed communications and economic data, I expect moderate likelihood of a rate cut at the May meeting. The March FOMC statement noted "somewhat elevated" inflation and "solid" economic growth, suggesting caution in easing policy too quickly. However, with Core PCE inflation trending down to 2.6% and some weakening in employment, conditions are aligning for continued policy normalization. The outcomes are skewed slightly toward no change, reflecting the Fed's historically cautious approach and recent pause in cuts. Given potential impacts from new tariffs and ongoing economic uncertainty, there is a meaningful risk of tail outcomes in either direction.

[Negative]

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT lower rates from the current target range (4.25%-4.50%) to a lower target range (4.00%-4.25%) at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (35.84%, 64.16%*)

A: Given the current economic environment, I expect the Fed is more likely than not to hold rates steady at the May meeting, despite market expectations for cuts. The persistence of somewhat elevated inflation combined with solid economic growth and stable labor markets suggests a cautious approach to easing. Recent FOMC communications and the March meeting outcome indicate a continued pause is quite possible, though there's notable uncertainty skewed toward potential easing given the projected rate path. The new tariff policies create additional inflationary pressures that may cause the Fed to be more patient with cuts.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (37.66%*, 62.34%)

A: I expect there is a moderate chance of a rate cut at the May meeting, given the continuing decline in inflation and signs of labor market softening mentioned in the March statement. My prediction reflects increased uncertainty around the economic outlook, with results skewed toward a higher probability of maintaining current rates due to still-elevated inflation and solid economic activity. While the Fed projects two more cuts in 2025, the timing remains uncertain, and recent tariff implementation could create inflationary pressures that may delay cuts.

[Negative]

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (28.14%, 71.86%*)

A: I expect there's a moderately high probability that the Fed will maintain current rates rather than cut, given the mixed signals in recent economic data and persistent inflation concerns. While the Fed has signaled potential rate cuts in 2025, the timing remains uncertain, especially with recent tariff implementations potentially creating new inflationary pressures. The outcomes are somewhat skewed toward maintaining rates, particularly given the Fed's recent cautious approach and preference for maintaining higher rates until inflation is firmly under control. There is a relatively low risk of extreme outcomes given the clear communication from the Fed about their measured approach to policy changes.

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (38.99%*, 61.01%)

A: Given the recent March FOMC statement indicating elevated inflation and solid economic growth, I expect a moderate probability of a rate cut at the May meeting. The committee's language suggests they are being cautious about easing policy too quickly, though they have signaled openness to cuts in 2025. Outcomes are likely skewed toward the downside given rising unemployment and slowing balance sheet reduction, but there is significant uncertainty due to new tariffs potentially reigniting inflation pressures. Results are concentrated around my central estimate due to the Fed's clear communication and historical tendency to move gradually.

[Negative]

Q: What is the probability that the Fed will NOT change the target fed funds range from 4.25%-4.50% to 4.00%-4.25% at the May 7, 2025 meeting?

Pred: (28.13%, 71.87%*)

A: I expect there is a high probability the Fed will maintain current rates, given the March statement's emphasis on needing more confidence in the inflation trajectory. The distribution is notably skewed toward maintaining rates, particularly given the recent pause in the cutting cycle and ongoing economic uncertainty. While new tariffs could create inflationary pressures, making cuts less likely, there remains some tail risk of adverse economic developments that could force the Fed's hand toward a cut.
