        "notes": "Based on the satellite imagery analysis, I expect there is a moderately low probability these are all genuine systems. The layout and positioning of the systems appears somewhat irregular and scattered, which is atypical for Russian air defense deployments. I predict with relatively high certainty that at least some of these are decoys, given the visible revetments and dispersal pattern that seems designed more for deception than operational effectiveness. The distribution is skewed toward the lower probabilities, as the presence of multiple suspicious indicators (like the seemingly haphazard placement and unusual number of systems) suggests deliberate deception efforts.",
