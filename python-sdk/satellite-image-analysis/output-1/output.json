        "notes": "Based on the satellite imagery analysis, I observe concerning patterns in the deployment that suggest potential deception. The systems appear too regularly spaced and exposed for actual high-value air defense assets, which typically employ more sophisticated concealment. The apparent lack of supporting equipment, personnel activity, and associated infrastructure that would normally accompany operational S-300/S-400 batteries raises significant doubts. I expect there's a high likelihood that at least some of these are decoys, with my analysis suggesting only a small chance all four are genuine active systems. The uncertainty is skewed toward the lower probabilities, though there remains a small but non-zero chance these could be real systems deliberately positioned to create strategic ambiguity.",

The spacing and positioning appears somewhat artificial and theatrical, lacking the typical operational security measures I would expect for such valuable assets. My uncertainty is moderately high given the resolution limitations, but the results are skewed toward finding at least one fake system, particularly because the visible shadows and dimensions show some inconsistencies typical of decoy deployments. The placement pattern suggests these could be part of a deception operation, especially given Russia's documented use of such tactics in this conflict.",

The uniform angular placement in a rough square formation is atypical of real Russian air defense deployments, which typically feature more irregular spacing and terrain-based positioning. I observe a lack of supporting equipment and infrastructure that would normally accompany operational S-300/S-400 batteries. The shadows and visual signatures suggest these could be inflatable or constructed decoys, which Russia is known to employ.
